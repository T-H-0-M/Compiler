/**
 - This program is a grade calculator that calculates the final scores and grades for a group of students based on their assignment marks.
 - It takes input for the number of students and the number of assignments, and then prompts the user to enter the student IDs and assignment grades.
 - The program then calculates the final score for each student by summing up their assignment grades and assigns a grade based on the final score.
 - Finally, it prints out the scores and grades for all students and identifies the top student based on the highest final score.
